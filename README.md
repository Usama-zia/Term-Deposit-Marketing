1- to install jupyter book so it can use virtual environment
```
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels
```

2- to create virtual environment and install requirements
```
conda create --name term-analysis pip ipykernel
source activate term-analysis
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Usama-zia/term-analysis.git
cd term-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3- now use following commands to first deactivate environment and then open jupyter notebook
